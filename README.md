## Overview ðŸŒŸ
This project addresses solutions to practical programming challenges posed in the "Introduction to Big Data Analytics" course (INSY 841J). The course aims to equip students with foundational skills in handling and analyzing large datasets using Python, focusing on data input, processing, and output techniques. The questions explored hereâ€”building a Student Management System and checking palindromesâ€”serve to enhance problem-solving abilities, reinforce functional programming concepts, and prepare students for real-world data management tasks.

## Questions and Solutions ðŸ’»
### Question I: Student Management System Function
**Objective**: Create a Student Management System that:
- Combines all concepts to build a function which:
  - Inputs student information (name, age, and grades for two or three courses)
  - Calculates the average of the marks
  - Stores and displays the studentâ€™s information along with their average grade
- Uses separate functions for each operation (input, calculation, display)

**Solution**: The following Python code implements the Student Management System:

- **How it Works**: The system prompts the user to input a student's name, age, and grades for three subjects, calculates the average, and displays the results.
