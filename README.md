This project addresses solutions to practical programming challenges posed in the "Introduction to Big Data Analytics" course (INSY 841J). The course aims to equip students with foundational skills in handling and analyzing large datasets using Python, focusing on data input, processing, and output techniques. The questions explored hereâ€”building a Student Management System and checking palindromesâ€”serve to enhance problem-solving abilities, reinforce functional programming concepts, and prepare students for real-world data management tasks.
